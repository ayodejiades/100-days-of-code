Dance With The Devil - Blxst & Anderson .Paak 

Dance With The Devil Lyrics
[Refrain: Anderson .Paak]
Ooh, actin' brand new
She get to actin' so brand new, yeah
'Cause I never seen you dance like this before
Where did you get it from?
It's a bad move
Ooh, you can dance with the devil if you want to
It's a bad move
So I think it's best we leave it on the floor

[Chorus: Blxst]
Yeah, uh
Is it safe to say you miss what we had? (Miss what we had or no?)
Girl, I might just save you just one more dance
Did I give you everything that you asked from me?
When it all falls down, I guess it's your bad

[Post-Chorus: Blxst]
I checked my schedule
I can't tell when you feel in love
You's a devil
Still I choose to dance with you
I checked my schedule
I can't tell when you feel in love (In love)
In love (In love)

[Verse 1: Blxst]
Uh, you was taking take things personal
I ain't do it on purpose though
And it hurt to know
Can't be what it been before
My inspiration to my verses though
I ain't even wanna speak to you
All a sudden, had a drink or two
And I think of you, but
I don't wanna go down that road, it's a dead-end
I should've known to go home, but I slid in
Wish you well, uh, uh
Time will tell it all
Oh, well, yeah
I'm fine against the wall
Wish you well (Wish you well)
I'm not sorry if you fallin', I can't catch you
I'm just a vibe you might two-step to, no, uh (Oh)

[Chorus: Blxst]
Yeah, uh
Is it safe to say you miss what we had? (Miss what we had or no?)
Girl, I might just save you just one more dance
Did I give you everything that you asked from me?
When it all falls down, I guess it's your bad
[Post-Chorus: Blxst]
I checked my schedule
I can't tell when you feel in love
You's a devil
Still I choose to dance with you
I checked my schedule
I can't tell when you feel in love (In love)
In love (In love)

[Refrain: Anderson .Paak]
Ooh, actin' brand new
She get to actin' so brand new, yeah
'Cause I never seen you dance like this before
Where did you get it from?
It's a bad move
Ooh, you can dance with the devil if you want to
It's a bad move
So I think it's best we leave it on the floor

[Verse 2: Anderson .Paak]
Devil in a blue dress (Dress)
White diamonds on your neck
Red bottoms when you step
Everybody in the party like, "Who's that?" (Yes)
But I caught it when you blew that kiss with those maroon lips
Started with a two-step (One, two step)
Now they lookin' like, "Damn, y'all ain't got a room yet?"
Now we could do the dash or save the last dance
Either way, I ain't mad
But may I ask
[Chorus: Blxst, Anderson .Paak]
Yeah, uh
Is it safe to say you miss what we had? (Miss what we had or no? If it's safe to say, let me know)
Girl, I might just save you just one more dance (Could be the history, could be the chemistry)
Did I give you everything that you asked from me? (Let's leave it all on the dancefloor)
When it all falls down, I guess it's your bad (Dang)

[Post-Chorus: Blxst]
I checked my schedule
I can't tell when you feel in love
You's a devil
Still I choose to dance with you
I checked my schedule
I can't tell when you feel in love (In love)
In love (In love)

[Outro]
Mm, mm, mm
You fell for the trap again
